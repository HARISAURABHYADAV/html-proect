                  <p>The electricity and gas used by UK households is responsible for a quarter of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Switching to clean power is a great way to reduce your own home’s impact.

                    Even if you’ve already switched to a renewable power supplier, you can help even more by reducing the amount of energy you use. As well as being better for the planet, it will help reduce your bills too.
                    
                    To help you get started, here are our top 20 tips for saving electricity at home:<br>
                    <br>
                    #1 Switch to LED Bulbs <br>
                    
                    They're far more efficient than incandescent lightbulbs, last longer and can provide a cleaner, more natural looking light. 
                    <br>
                    #2 Install smart switches<br>
                    
                    There's loads available, from simple timed switches to ones that can be controlled remotely from your smartphone. This makes it much easier to make sure that your electronics aren't left on standby. 
                    <br>
                    #3 Turn it off at the switch<br>
                    
                    Leaving electronics on standby means that electricity is still being used so they can be turned on at a moment’s notice. Turning these appliances off at the wall stops this from happening – you could even use a smart switch as mentioned in the point above. (This counts for your lights as well, an LED will reduce cost but turning them off will cut it completely). 
                    <br>
                    #4 Clean the coils on your fridge <br>
                    
                    Chances are you’ve never bothered to do this. The coils on the back of your fridge can get really dirty which reduces efficiency, so aim to give them a clean at least once a year. Your fridge will last longer and cost less money to keep running.
                    <br>
                    #5 Keep your fridge and freezer full<br>
                    You don’t always need to do a food shop to make this happen. Simply filling up a jug with water for the fridge will have the same effect, plus this allows you to always have cold water straight from the fridge, saving water when running the tap. To keep your freezer full why not fill the empty spaces with paper?
                    <br>
                    #6 Keep your fridge and freezer warmer 
                    <br>
                    Turning your fridge and freezer up by just one degree won’t make any difference to you, but it can save a whole lot of energy over the year.
                    <br>
                    #7 Defrost frozen food in the fridge 
                    <br>
                    Not only is this more hygienic to do, the frozen food will help keep your fridge cool meaning that it needs much less power to run.
                    <br>
                    A full fridge-freezer needs less energy to keep cold as the items inside maintain the temperature.
                    <br>
                    #12 Don’t boil a full kettle
                    <br>
Unless you’re making tea for eight people, there’s not much call to keep the kettle full. Not only does it take longer to boil, it requires more energy to do so – simply filling for roughly the amount you need to use can save you money and time with every cuppa.
<br>
#13 Purchase energy efficient appliances 
<br>
This is an expensive one to get into, but if you’re upgrading appliances then making sure you get one with a high efficiency rating will help save you money every day that it’s running.
