RESOLUTION

No. 23/40/2004-R&R (Vol.II)

1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1 In compliance with section 3 of the Electricity Act 2003 the Central Government hereby notifies the National Electricity Policy.

1.2 Electricity is an essential requirement for all facets of our life. It has been recognized as a basic human need.
 It is a critical infrastructure on which the socio-economic development of the country depends. Supply of electricity at reasonable 
 rate to rural India is essential for its overall development. Equally important is availability of reliable and quality power at 
 competitive rates to Indian industry to make it globally competitive and to enable it to exploit the tremendous potential of 
 employment generation. Services sector has made significant contribution to the growth of our economy.
  Availability of quality supply of electricity is very crucial to sustained growth of this segment.

1.3 Recognizing that electricity is one of the key drivers for rapid economic growth and poverty alleviation, the nation has set itself 
the target of providing access to all households in next five years. As per Census 2001, about 44% of the households do not have access
 to electricity. Hence meeting the target of providing universal access is a daunting task requiring significant addition to generation 
 capacity and expansion of the transmission and distribution network.

1.4 Indian Power sector is witnessing major changes. Growth of Power Sector in India since its Independence has been noteworthy. 
However, the demand for power has been outstripping the growth of availability. Substantial peak and energy shortages prevail in the country. 
This is due to inadequacies in generation, transmission & distribution as well as inefficient use of electricity. Very high level of
 technical and commercial losses and lack of commercial approach in management of utilities has led to unsustainable financial operations. 
 Cross-subsidies have risen to unsustainable levels. Inadequacies in distribution networks has been one of the major reasons for poor
  quality of supply.

1.5 Electricity industry is capital-intensive having long gestation period. Resources of power generation are unevenly dispersed across the 
country. Electricity is a commodity that can not be stored in the grid where demand and supply have to be continuously balanced. The widely 
distributed and rapidly increasing demand requirements of the country need to be met in an optimum manner.

1.6 Electricity Act, 2003 provides an enabling framework for accelerated and more efficient development of the power sector. The Act seeks 
to encourage competition with appropriate regulatory intervention. Competition is expected to yield efficiency gains and in turn result in 
availability of quality supply of electricity to consumers at competitive rates.

1.7 Section 3 (1) of the Electricity Act 2003 requires the Central Government to formulate, inter alia, the National Electricity Policy in
 consultation with Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and State Governments. The provision is quoted below:
